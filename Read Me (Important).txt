Hey me,
-> use env-local as env file for local development
-> use env-cpanel when deploying to cpanel
-> make sure to run "php artisan storage:link
" command to link the storage folder to public
-> when deploying to cpanel , create a file ".htaccess" and paste this to make public directory the root directory
"
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
</IfModule>
"
(without the quotation marks)
-> try to update the google drive source code files once in a while, or when you do major changes both on code or database
